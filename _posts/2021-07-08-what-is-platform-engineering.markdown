### Initially
As a sysadmin, I was hoping that platform engineering was going to be a direct substitution of 
reponsibility for a physical server to one that is in the cloud. I wanted it to be 'Terraform will
layout the hardware' _in a virtual format_ and then the application teams will install their 
applications on that. I suppose that is the IaaS model but I should learn about the PaaS and SaaS 
models too.

### Now
I'm going go have to look at all the frameworks that exists (or at least understand am overview or 
just that they exist) and discover the wonders of containers (similar to Solaris zones from 20 years ago) 
with Kubernetes and Redshift.

We're going to report back to the [Cohort 4][Cohort4-channel] channel on [Teams][Teams-site], keep shared references in [MS Teams Wiki][Cohort4-wiki]. (I used labels here; back-to-back square brackets)
