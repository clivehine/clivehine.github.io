Initially it appears that it's copying someone else's homework - why re-invent the wheel! I guess it does mean we can learn from other's mistakes and add enhancements/improvements along the way.

So for this blog I did the following:
{% highlight html %}
git clone https://github.com/jekyll/minima.git 
bundle install
bundler exec jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}
There, someone else's learning used to provide a solution to a problem. I can add some enhancements (added favicon.ico) and started creating more data e.g. [Donations](http://localhost:4000/donate.html){:target="_blank"}; (My _md_ used 'open in new tab' here!!).

I was trying to reference as many features and capabilities of markdown as and when I learn of each of the features.

I learnt more by checking out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] to try and get more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. I can file all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. I could ask questions, I'd ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

Blooming complicated. I just touching the surface of these tools capabilities.
